# Problem and its solution
The function I added
There were only version changes, everything else was according to the instructions 


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.


### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
