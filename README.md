# Welcome to My Yelp
***QWASAR My Yelp***

## Task
A fully hosted version in the cloud. (at least until the correction happened)
Each of these providers have a free tier. You should be able to host it for 0$. :)

You will write the url in my_yelp_url.txt. Nothing more, just the URL.

## Description
Deploy an application built in ReactJS into Amplify (AWS) using authentification.

We've provided to you the code of an application and we would like it to be hosted in the cloud.
This application is also using GraphQL, you might have to take a look. :)

You are one hundred percent allowed to edit the source code; your mission is simple: make it work.

## Installation
npm install 

## Usage
npm start
