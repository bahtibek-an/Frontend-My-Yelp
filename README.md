# Task

You've been assigned by your manager to deploy an old application to the cloud.

It's an excellent timing since you've just completed your training on AWS. A mix of Amplify, lambda and other technology will be perfect for this project.

A little about Yelp (source wikipedia):

Deploy an application built in ReactJS into Amplify (AWS) using authentification.

We've provided to you the code of an application and we would like it to be hosted in the cloud. This application is also using GraphQL, you might have to take a look. :)

You are one hundred percent allowed to edit the source code; your mission is simple: make it work.
