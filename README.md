# Description

Yelp was founded in 2004 by former PayPal employees Russel Simmons and Jeremy Stoppelman. Yelp grew in usage and raised several rounds of funding in the following years. By 2010, it had $30 million in revenue, and the website had published about 4.5 million crowd-sourced reviews. From 2009 to 2012, Yelp expanded throughout Europe and Asia. In 2009, it entered unsuccessful negotiations to be acquired by Google. Yelp became a public company via an initial public offering in March 2012 and became profitable for the first time two years later.

As of December 31, 2020, approximately 206.3 million reviews were available on its business listing pages. In 2020, the company had 43 million unique visitors to its desktop webpages and 52 million unique visitors to its mobile sites. Over fifty percent of the company's audience has annual household income of more than $100,000.
