## Task
Hello, and welcome to My Yelp! I'm delighted that you're exploring my code. This project presented some challenges initially, but with the guidance of my mentors, I was able to organize and complete it.

## Description
My Yelp is a clone of the Yelp website. It provides users with the ability to add their own restaurants and explore listings of other restaurants.

Installation
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:
Clone the repository:
bash
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
cd yelp
Install dependencies for both the server and the client:
bash
npm install
## Usage
Once the installation is complete, you can run the project with the following commands:

bash
# Start the server
npm run server

# Start the client
npm start
This will launch the application locally, and you can access it in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.
## The Core Team
This project was created by a solo developer, without a dedicated team. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you for checking out My Yelp! I hope you enjoy exploring the restaurants and functionalities provided by this project.
