## Task

The problem is to deploy an existing ReactJS application that also uses 

GraphQL into the AWS Amplify environment with authentication. 

The challenge here lies in the following aspects:

Setting up an AWS Amplify environment and connecting it to the existing codebase.

Configuring authentication within the application.

Ensuring that the application works as expected in the cloud environment.

## Description

To solve this problem, I followed these steps:

Created an AWS Amplify environment for the project.

Connected the Amplify environment to the existing ReactJS codebase.

Configured authentication in Amplify and integrated it with the ReactJS application.

Deployed the application to AWS Amplify.

Verified that the deployed application works correctly in the cloud environment.

## Installation

To install and set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the Git repository containing the ReactJS project.

Navigate to the project's root directory.

Run npm install to install the project dependencies.

Configure the AWS Amplify environment as needed (e.g., authentication settings, AWS resources).

Run npm start to start the development server locally and test the application.

## Usage

Once the project is set up locally and dependencies are installed, running npm start will start the development server, 

and you can access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:3000 by default.

Users can interact with the ReactJS application, and if authentication is configured, 
they will need to sign in or sign up as required.

After thoroughly testing the application locally to ensure it works as expected, 

you can deploy it to AWS Amplify by using Amplify's deployment commands. 

Once deployed, the application will be accessible on the provided cloud URL.

The URL of the deployed application should be placed in the my_yelp_url.txt file, as requested.
